# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was built with JS, React and MySQL based on this tutorial of PedroTech(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNY_PYGxrdc).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory cd into the client folder and run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

In the project directory cd into the server folder and run:

### `npm start`

Starts the server on localhost 3001.
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

Make sure that you have MySQL Workbench and the MySQL Server installed on your machine, in order to connect with this app. You have to create a db called PasswordManager and table called passwords, columns to create are (for this project) website, password, username, email but feel free to adjust these to your own needs.
